_[ A brief synopsis of this library ]._

</p>


## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Xcode installation is not officialy supported, as this library is for linux only.

### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `SwiftyALSA` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/Vaidios/SwiftyALSA.git",
            branch: "master"
        ),
    ],
    //...
)
```

From there, refer to the `ALSA` "product" delivered by the `SwiftyALSA` "package" inside of any of your project's target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
            .product(
                name: "ALSA",
                package: "SwiftyALSA"
            ),
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

Then simply `import ALSA` wherever you‚Äôd like to use it.
